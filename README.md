Thank you for giving me the opportunity to demonstrate my skills in this project.
Oddly enough I have never had a chance to create a custom native module. It's been a fun experience learning how to connect MPAndroidChart/Charts with this project.

I added a few features and styling to make it look similar to a Divvy product. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did coding it.

Feel free to reach out with any question.
